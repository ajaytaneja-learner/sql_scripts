/*
Highest Number of Products
1)Assume that you are given the table below containing information on various orders made by eBay customers. 
2)Write a query to obtain the user IDs and number of products purchased by the top 3 customers; these customers must have spent at least $1,000 in total.
3)Output the user id and number of products in descending order. 
4)To break ties (i.e., if 2 customers both bought 10 products), the user who spent more should take precedence.
