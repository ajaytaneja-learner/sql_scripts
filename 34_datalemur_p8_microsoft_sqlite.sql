/*
1) Microsoft Azure's capacity planning team wants to understand how much data its customers are using, 
and how much spare capacity is left in each of it's data centers. Youâ€™re given three tables: 
customers, datacenters, and forecasted_demand.
2) Write a query to find the total monthly unused server capacity for each data center. 
Output the data center id in ascending order and the total spare capacity.
